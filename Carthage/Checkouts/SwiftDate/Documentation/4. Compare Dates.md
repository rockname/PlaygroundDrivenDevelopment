 # 4. COMPARE DATES
 
Date comparison is available both for `Date` and `DateInRegion` objects. You can do comparison using standard mathematical operators or using special functions exposed by the library.<br>
The following guide list all of them.

## Generic Comparison
* Mathematical Operators (`<,<=,>,>=`)

* `compare(to:,granularity:) -> ComparisonResult` (for `DateInRegion`)
* `compare(to:,in:,granularity:) -> ComparisonResult` (for `Date`)

* `isIn(date:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `DateInRegion`)
* `isIn(date:,in:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `Date`)

* `isBefore(date:,orEqual:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `DateInRegion`)
* `isBefore(date:,orEqual:,in:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `Date`)

* `isAfter(date:,orEqual:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `DateInRegion`)
*  `isAfter(date:,orEqual:,in:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `Date`)

* `isEqual(to:) -> Bool` (for `DateInRegion`)

* `isBetween(date:,and:,orEqual:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `DateInRegion`)
* `isBetween(date:,and:,orEqual:,in:,granularity:) -> Bool` (for `Date`)

## Day Comparison

# GENERIC COMPARISON

### Mathematical Operators
Common mathematical operators can be used to compare two `Date` or `DateInRegion` instances.
Assuming `a` and `b` two dates (as `Date` or `DateInRegion` instances).<br>
These operators can be used to perform fast comparisor:

* `a > b` = is `a` later than `b`? 
* `a >= b` = is `a` later or equal than `b`?
* `a < b` = is `a` earlier than `b`?
* `a <= b` = is `a` earlier or equal than `b`?

### `compare(to:,granularity:) -> ComparisonResult` for `DateInRegion`
Returns a `ComparisonResult` value that indicates the ordering of two given dates based on their components down to a given unit granularity.
Possible return values are:
* `orderedSame`: if the dates are the same down to the given granularity
*  `orderedAscending`: the left operand is smaller than the right operand.
*   `orderedDescending`: the left operand is greater than the right operand.

#### Parameters
* `date` (`DateInRegion`): date to compare against receiver.
* `granularity` (`Calendar.Component`): The smallest unit that must, along with all larger units, be equal for the given dates to be considered the same. For possible values see “[Calendar Units](xcdoc://?url=developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSCalendar_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSCalendarUnit)”

### `compare(to:,in:,granularity:) -> ComparisonResult` (for `Date`)
Returns a ComparisonResult value that indicates the ordering of two given dates based on their components down to a given unit granularity. Both passed `Date` objects are expressed in passed region before doing the comparison.

#### Parameters
* `date` (`Date`): date to compare against receiver.

* `granularity` (`Calendar.Component`): The smallest unit that must, along with all larger units, be equal for the given dates to be considered the same. For possible values see “[Calendar Units](xcdoc://?url=developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSCalendar_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSCalendarUnit)”
